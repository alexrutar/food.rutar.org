# About
This is a repository for my [personal recipe website](https://food.rutar.org).
The site is built using the [zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) static content generator.
If you want to build this locally, just `git clone`, change into the directory, and `zola serve`.
My site is hosted on [Cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).
