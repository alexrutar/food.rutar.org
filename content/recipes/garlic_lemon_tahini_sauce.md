3-4 lemons

1 large head garlic (approx. 20 cloves)

½ tsp (2g) ground cumin

300g tahini paste

fine salt
<!-- sep -->
Separate the head of garlic into unpeeled cloves of garlic.
Squeeze the lemon juice into a blender, add the garlic, and then pulse until the mixture becomes a think paste (approx. 20 short pulses).

Put the mixture into a fine mesh strainer and using the back of a spoon, squeeze the liquid into a large bowl.
Add the tahini paste, and mix with a whisk.
At first, the mixture will be very thick: slowly add cold water (approx. 1 tbsp at a time), while mixing, until the mixture is smooth and barely liquid.

Add salt to taste.

<!-- sep -->
The blending duration is critical: if you under-blend, the garlic will not separate properly from the cloves, and if you over-blend, then the lemon will mix too thoroughly with the garlic and neutralize the flavours.
