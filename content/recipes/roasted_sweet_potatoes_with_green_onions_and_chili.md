4 small sweet potatoes

olive oil

salt and pepper

1 red chili, de-seeded and thinly sliced

12 green onions, cut in half lengthwise and into quarters

date syrup
<!-- sep -->
Preheat oven to 240°C/220°C fan.
Cut the sweet potatoes into 6 long wedges.
Toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper, spread on baking sheet, skin side down, and cook for 20m-25m until soft but not overcooked.

Once the potatoes are, place on counter to cool somewhat.
Heat olive oil and stir-fry spring onions and red chili over medium heat.
Transfer the potatoes to a serving platter, then spoon it over with the green onions and chili and any excess olive oil in the pan.
Drizzle with date syrup and serve.
<!-- sep -->
If you don't have date syrup, you can make a sweet balsamic vinegar reduction by cooking 40ml balsamic vinegar with 20g caster sugar in a small saucepan until syrupy.
