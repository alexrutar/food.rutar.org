150ml white wine

120ml cream

Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat.
Add the shallots and cook until translucent.
Turn the heat to high, add the butter and reindeer, and fry until lightly browned.

Deglaze with the white wine and add the stock concentrate.
Stir well, and cook for 2m.
Add the mushrooms as well as some salt and black pepper, lower the heat to medium, cover, and cook for 20m.
Occasionally check the liquid at the bottom of the pan: there should be some liquid, but not too much.
If it is dry, add more wine or water.

Pour the cream into a small bowl and temper with the hot stock from the pan.
Add cream, stir well, then add the breadcrumbs and mix thoroughly.
Cook for 10m until the sauce is fully thickened.
