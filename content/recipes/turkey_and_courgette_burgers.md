<!-- sep -->
Preheat oven to 220°C / 200°C Fan.
Mix all the ingredients (apart from the sunflower oil) in a large bowl.

Once evenly mixed, shape into burgers, about 45g each and about 18.
Pour sunflower oil into a large frying pan to form a thin layer on the bottom.
Prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Sear at medium heat in batches until browned on all sides, and transfer to prepared sheet.
Bake in the oven for 5-7 minutes, or until just cooked through.

Serve with [soured cream and sumac sauce](@/recipes/soured_cream_and_sumac_sauce.md).

The mix is pretty soft when uncooked, but it firms up nicely once fried.
