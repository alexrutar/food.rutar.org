Preheat oven to 130C fan.

Wash oxtail and pat dry.
Trim off excess fat, and put half the oxtail in a freezer bag with the flour and all the spices.

In batches, heat the oil in a large heavy-bottom pot, and brown the oxtail for 10m until dark brown all over.
Set aside.

Add a bit of extra oil to the pan and add the onions, carrots, celery, and garlic.
Cook gently until softened and lightly browned, approx. 10m.
Add red wine, and bring to a boil.
Add oxtail, beef stock, and tomato purée, and bring to a simmer.

Cover with lid and cook in the oven for 3h.
After 1.5h, turn over the oxtail in the sauce.
Remove from oven and skim excess fat.

Serve with chopped parsley.
