250g dried butter beans, soaked overnight in plenty of cold water with ½ tbsp bicarbonate of soda

4 garlic cloves, crushed

2½ tbsp lemon juice (or 1 preserved lemon)

90ml olive oil

Fine sea salt and black pepper
<!-- sep -->
Drain the soaked beans and put them in a large saucepan.
Cover with lots of fresh water, bring to a boil, then simmer gently for 45m and up to an hour and a half, until completely soft.
Drain, retaining the cooking water.
While they are still hot, put the beans in the bowl of a blender / food processor and add the garlic, lemon juice (or preserved lemon), olive oil, 80ml of the cooking water, a teaspoon of salt and some black pepper.
Blitz to a very smooth purée, transfer to a bowl, cover the surface with clingfilm and leave to cool down.
<!-- sep -->
Serve over toast, or garnished with [dukkah](@/recipes/dukkah.md), grated hard-boiled egg, and freshly chopped parsley.
