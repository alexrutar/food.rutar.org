1 onion, thinly sliced

1 red cabbage, outer layers removed

2 eating apples, peeled and cut into 2.5cm cubes

2 slices smoked streaky bacon, thinly sliced

Â½ a bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped

olive oil

1 tablespoon fennel seeds

150 ml balsamic vinegar

1 small knob of unsalted butter
<!-- sep -->
Remove the outer leaves from the cabbage, remove the core, and chop into irregular chunks.

Pour plenty of oil into a pan over a medium heat, add the bacon, then crush and add the fennel seeds and cook until golden.

Add the onion, cover, and continue to cook for 5-10m, or until lightly golden and sticky.

Add the apple and cabbage, season with sea salt, black pepper and the vinegar, then stir well.

Put the lid back on, reduce the heat to low, and cook gently for 1 hour, or until sticky and sweet, stirring occasionally.

Scoop into a serving dish, melt the butter on top and sprinkle with the parsley, and serve.
