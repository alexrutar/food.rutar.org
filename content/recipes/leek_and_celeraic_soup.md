50g unsalted butter

1 tbsp olive oil

About 500g peeled celeriac, roughly chopped (peeled weight)

2 tender inner sticks of celery, chopped

2 leeks, washed and sliced

1 potato (about 150g), peeled and roughly chopped

1 medium onion, peeled and chopped

2 garlic cloves, peeled and chopped

About 1.25 litres light chicken or fish stock, or vegetable stock

½ glass white wine

100ml double cream, plus a little extra

Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
<!-- sep -->
Place a large saucepan over a medium-low heat and add the butter and olive oil.
When the butter is foaming, stir in all the chopped vegetables and garlic.
Cook gently for about 10m until everything is softened but not coloured.
Pour in the stock and wine and bring to a gentle simmer.
Cover and cook for 20–25m, stirring once or twice, until all the vegetables are tender.

Purée the soup in a blender, in batches if necessary, until smooth.
If it seems a little thick, thin with a bit more stock or water.
Return to the pan.

To finish the soup, stir in the cream, if including.
Warm the soup through gently and season with salt and pepper to taste.
Ladle into warm bowls and pop the poached oysters on top or add a splash of cream and a sprinkling of chives to serve.

The wine makes a big difference - don't omit it.
