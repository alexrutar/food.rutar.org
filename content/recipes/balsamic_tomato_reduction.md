In a large saute pan heat the olive oil over medium/low heat.
Add cherry tomatoes and sauté until the skin starts to wrinkle and they start to burst, 6-8m.

Season with salt and stir gently.

Add the balsamic vinegar to the pan and cook until reduced with a syrup-like texture, about 12m.
Remove mixture from heat and let cool.
