Add egg yolks and vanilla extract (to taste) and beat until thick.

Combine the flour, ground black sesame seeds and cream in a small bowl, and thoroughly combine.
Then, carefully mix into the meringue (preserving the structure of the meringue as much as possible).
Half way through mixing, add the sesame oil, and continue until just combined.

Pour the batter into the rice cooker's inner cooking pan and bake on the "CAKE" setting for 45 min.
