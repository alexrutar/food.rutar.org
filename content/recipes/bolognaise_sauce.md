In a large saucepan over high heat, soften the vegetables in the butter for 5m.
Season with salt and pepper.
Add the pancetta, mortadella and ground meats.
Cook the meat, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, and stir occasionally until the cooking juices have evaporated and the meat has browned.

Deglaze with the wine and reduce until almost dry.
Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1m.
Add the broth, bay leaves, herbs and pepper flakes.
Cover and let simmer over medium-low heat for 1h, stirring occasionally.

You really want to finely chop the cured meats and vegetables.
An easy way to do this is to use a food processer (process meat and vegetables separately).

Don't omit the red wine.

Traditionally, serve with egg noodles and grated parmesan.
