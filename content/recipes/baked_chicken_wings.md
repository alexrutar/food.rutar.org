1kg chicken wings

3 tbsp flour

1 tbsp paprika

½ tbsp ground chili powder

1 tsp ground cumin

1 tsp ground coriander

1 tsp ground pepper

½ tsp salt

vegetable oil

<!-- sep -->

Preheat the oven to 220°C (200°C fan).

Thoroughly dry the chicken, and place in a large mixing bowl or freezer bag.
Combine the spices with the flour, and toss with the chicken wings until completely coated.

Line a baking sheet with foil and brush the foil with the oil until evenly coated.
Arrange the chicken with plenty of space in between (do this in multiple batches, if necessary).
Bake for 20m, flip the chicken wings, then bake for another 15m.
Serve plain or with dipping sauce.
