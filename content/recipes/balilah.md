Drain the chickpeas and place them in a large saucepan with plenty of water.
Bring to a boil, and simmer for 60-90m until chickpeas are soft but still maintain their shape.

While the chickpeas are cooking, add the parsley and spring onions to a large bowl.
Skin the lemon and remove its white pith, rougly chop it, and add the flesh to the bowl along with its juices.

Once the chickpeas are cooked, drain them and add them to the bowl while they are still hot.
Add the olive oil, cumin, allspice, ¾ tsp salt, and ground black pepper.
Mix well, allow to cool to room temperature, and serve.

Also goes nicely with tomatoes, cucumber, feta and leaves to make a salad.
